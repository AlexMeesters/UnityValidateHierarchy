# Unity Validate Hierarchy
Script that calls OnValidate when components/gameobjects are added or removed of a child of the root object.

Currently there is one limitation on the script, it only works if the script is on the root of an object. This will/can change in the future if there is enough demand for it. I currently don't have the time to implement this modification.

Used for [Health Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/health-pro-effects-132006?aid=1101lHUQ) &amp; Additive Save System (Coming soon)
